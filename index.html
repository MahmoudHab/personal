        <p>Mahmoud Abdellatif is the founder of Acquid Capital, a venture capital firm that invests in the best startups worldwide.</p>
        <p>Mahmoud Abdellatif has always had a fascination with economics and finance. He published his first academic paper at the age of 14, and at the age of 16, he conducted his first experiment at Harvard Kennedy School. He believes that youth ambition is dwindling, with many students opting to work for large corporations or create meaningless projects, so he is taking a risk in order to make a significant impact in investing and sustainable investing.</p>
        <p>Mahmoud Abdellatif currently studies finance at both the undergraduate and graduate levels at New York University. Previously, he worked in military and national intelligence, researched and pushed legislation with Harvard, provided research to congress members through a shell company, worked at venture capital firms, developed code at multiple startups, and learned at the Federal Reserve.</p>
        <p>Mahmoud Abdellatif has received honors and commendations from members of the US Intelligence Community, Dr. Henry Kissinger, President Joe Biden, President Donald Trump, and President Barack Obama, as well as sitting members of Congress and the Federal Reserve. Despite this, his best compliment comes from a group of friends who all dropped out of college to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams.</p>
